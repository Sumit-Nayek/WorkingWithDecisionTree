# WorkingWithDecisionTree
Trying to do experiment with the decision tree algorithm 
## Introduction
This is Expremental work to get to understand the variaous parameter important with respect to different applicaion. 
## In this project I will try to develop a new approach to the decision tree algorithm
First we take a balanced dataset and see the aspects of the parameters
Based on that we want to select a appropiate measure for the numeric variables and also want to develop a new spliting condition
